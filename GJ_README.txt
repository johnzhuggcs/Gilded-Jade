Crusader Kings Jade Dragon v0.02 for 2.8.1

Jade Dragon and Legacy of Rome must be enabled (not too sure of other dlcs but I don't think it will matter too much)

An immersion-centered mod focused around the Eastern edge of the map and interactions on the Chinese polities available on the map...

What's new?
- fixed bug where none of the offmap China's dynasty members return to China after "fixing" the vanilla bug. Currently only the unlanded children and sibilings of the Emperor return to China
- fixed bug for automatic Temple Name assign where people repeatedly get assigned "Taizong" due to a faulty condition check
- fixed localisation bug, should now display realm size change properly in the Temple Name/Ritual of Tiao event chain.



Features:
Bug fix for 2.8.1: As far as I know 2.8.1 introduced a huge bug for the Borjigin family, in an attempt to reduce loitering of Chinese Emperor's relatives in 769 and other starts
	Paradox decided to send all members of the Chinese Emperor's dynasty back to China, yes even landed ones. So if you start at any bookmark after Ogdei Khan becomes
	Emperor of China, all the Borjigins khans will be stuck in China. I've sort of fixed it by only making unlanded sons and brothers of the Emperor returning.

CB: Han or Taoist characters now have access to a duchy-level conquest CB (Heavenly Conquest). 
	It ends in the duchy title usurped and original holder executed, but vassalizes the original vassals.

Temple Name system: You will now be able to assign Temple Names to dead or deposed Chinese Imperial Government Emperors depending on their deeds and actions
	By toggling the game rules you can manually choose from more than 70 distinct Temple Names OR have the game automatically give you to your ruler based on
	the character's actions (realm size increase? Wars won and lost in lifetime etc...). Look at the List of Temple Names for a full list.

Imperial Principality: Appendage Kingdom-level titles for kinsmen of Chinese Imperial Government with a spanwed 600 guard unit. Currently only a maximum of 10 can be given out (which are halved and quartered depending on vassal limit game rule)
	This is due to concerns regarding vassal limit. I don't want the AI to exceed the vassal limit because of this. Look at the list of Principalities for a full list.
	When any Imperial Principality inheirits another Principality, the newly inherited one will be destroyed along with the guard unit. Likewise if a Prince becomes the Emperor the title is destroyed.
	
Retinue: Created the "Xuanjia Cavalry" Light Cavalry retinue. Arguably a strong Chinese presence in Central Asia would always indicate a strong Cavalry force like the Han, Tang and to a small extent the Ming

Buildings: Created the light cavalry buildings, also changed the crossbow building descriptions to give more immersion.
	- Can now build sections of the Great Wall in Jiuquan/Hexi, giving boost to fort level and garrisons. The walls can be connected by a decision once you've built all of them.
	- Harem Court: boosts fertility and reduces taxation

Religion: Taoists can now navigate the river, the Chinese mostly had a greater river naval presence compared to the oceans due to geographical limits (along the Yangtze river especially)

Offmap: Change the gender chance of Chinese Emperors, Empresses are now considerably less likely to appear, the previous 1 in 20 chance was too ridiculous.
	But if the game rule was turned to gender equality it will become a 50/50 roll of genders.
	
	Temporarily changed all new spawning offmap Emperor's name to Era Names (which are their bynames in their lifetime). A temple name system will be implemented for them soon.
