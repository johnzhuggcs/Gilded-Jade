#Initial Menu
EVT_DESC_GJ_2;Since the Former Han Dynasty, Emperors' accomplishments were evaluated based on an intricate system of Temple and Posthumous names upon their death established by the "Rites of Zhou".\nChancellor [Root.job_chancellor.GetFullName] and other Ministers beseeches you to honour your predecessor appropriately, in order to bring about an auspicious reign.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GJ.2_GOODCOMPETENT;"The Late Emperor was a brilliant and competent Emperor, I shall honour them appropriately";;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GJ.2_FOUNDER;"As the founder of this dynasty, they must be given the highest of honours";;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GJ.2_MEH;"The Late Emperor was...relatively capabable";;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTG_GJ.3_EARLYDEATHORBATTLE;"They were destined for greatness, yet how soon the stars fall...";;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTH_GJ.3_RETURNPAGE;"Allow me to reconsider";;;;;;;;;x

#Chose GOODCOMPETENT Menu
EVT_DESC_GJ_4;Posthmous names provided by the "Rites of Zhou" called for a strict evaluation of your predecessor, with names assigned specific meanings to specific accomplishments of each ruler. The Late Emperor was a competent one, their accomplishments matched only by the few in our dynasty. Yet by what aspect of their reign shall they by honoured by is a matter of debate. \n\nWere they a responsible and competent Emperor who guarded their realm? or...\n\nDid they recreate the anew after a calamity? Or... \n\nExpanded the Empire to an unmatched extent?;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_GJ.4_SAVIOR;"They preserved our dynasty's fortunes in times of chaos";;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GJ.4_THEGREATMAGNIFICNET;"They were the Greatest, with unparalled glory!";;;;;;;;;x

EVT_DESC_GJ_0034;The previous Emperor was among the few of the founding ones that had fillially and diligently carried out The Progenitor's mission.\n\nLike Emperor Taizong of Tang and Taizong of Han, they alone maintained our Dynasties fortunes during the tumultuous early years, and they shall be hononured as such!;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_GJ.4_RETURNUP;Chancellor [Root.job_chancellor.GetFullName], allow me to reconsider...;;;;;;;;;x


#Chose SARCASTICORBAD Menu
EVT_DESC_GJ_5;Previous founders of dynasties were traditionally honoured either as the "Taizu - the Great Progenitor" like the Han, or the "Gaozu - the Supreme Progenitor" like the Tang.\nYour ministers anxiously debate the qualifications of your respected predecessor among the two.;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GJ.5_TAIZU;"Originator of the dynasty's fortunes, Taizu - the Great Progenitor";;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GJ.5_GAOZU;"No other ancestors matched them, Gaozu - the Supreme Progenitor";;;;;;;;;x

#Chose USURPATION_NOT_SAME_DYNASTY Menu
EVT_DESC_GJ_8;Although you have toppled the corrupt former dynasty and release the people from the shackles of their wickedness, it is customary to give them an appropriate title to cement their historical influences to come. \nDepending on their actions in the preceding wars against you, you should give them an insulting or consolating title that suits them;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GJ.8_ADULTUSURPED;"Their wickedness surpassed the ancient tyrants Jie and Zhou!";;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GJ.8_YOUNG;"They were just children burdened with their ancestor's folly";;;;;;;;;x

#Chose 


GIVETEMPLENAMEBADORSAR;Ritualistic Dillema;;;;;;;;;x
EVT_DESC_GJ_7;Your predecessor's actions were certainly questionable, but how would you honour them? If you were to follow the "Rites of Zhou" and give them a bad name, you certainly would be accused of being unfilial by your pesky ministers. On the other hand, you would desecrate your dynasty's temple if you were more lenient...;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GJ.7_SARCASTIC;They are my kin, I'll honour them as such;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GJ.7_BAD;Allowing their sprits to reside in the Temple is lenient already...;;;;;;;;;x

EVT_DESC_GJ_0034;The foundation of the dynasty was laiden by your ancestor, the Progenitor. But perhaps it was your predecessor was the one who truly preserved their hardwork. \nYour Minister of Rites peeked up and said, "By the annals of the sages, the one who expanded the Empire would be a "Zu", and one who preserved the grandeur was named "Zong". And among them, the Late Emperor was the most grand."  \nThus following examples of the Han Dynasty and the Tang Dynasty, the Late Emperor will be, Taizong the Great Successor!;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GJ.10_TAIZONG;They preserved the achievements of the Progenitor!;;;;;;;;;x


EVT_DESC_GJ_35;And with that, the rank and dignity of the late Emperor has been decided.\nLooking at the retreating shadows of Chancellor [Root.job_chancellor.GetFullName] and the Minister of Rites [Root.job_spiritual.GetFullName], you wonder if you've made a fair judgement of the cold corpse. But regardless, with your decision, the uncertainty of the rituals around the Mausoleum have been laid to rest. By the morning of the next day, the corpse shall be taken care of and All Under Heaven shall bow to you.\nAs customary, you have declared the next year to be the first year of the [Root.GetFirstName] Era, you trust that it will be the beginning of a glorious reign. \nSo long, [previous_title_holder.GetDeadChineseEmperorWithTempleName] and All Hail [Root.GetMediumChineseEmperorName]!;;;;;;;;;x
